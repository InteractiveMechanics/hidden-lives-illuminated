<h3>The Long Term</h3>
<p><em>The Long Term</em> is a hand-drawn animation developed by artists serving long term sentences. The video uses personal narrative and research to describe the scale and impact of long term sentencing policies. The work tells stories about the fear of dying inside, feeling of being programmed by prison and the impact on family life, from the perspective of 12 artists serving life or long term sentences.</p>

<p>This project is part of a larger body of thematic work by artists, writers and members of the <a href="http://p-nap.org/" target="_blank">Prison + Neighborhood Arts Project</a> around long-term sentencing policies and the other long terms they produce: long-term struggles for freedom, long-term loss in communities, and long-term relationships behind the prison wall.</p>
