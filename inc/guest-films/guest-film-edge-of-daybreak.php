<h3>The Edge of Daybreak</h3>
<p>Edge of Daybreakâ€™s members, James Carrington, Jamal Jaha Nubi, Cornelius Cade, Harry Coleman, and McEvoy Robinson, met in Powhatan Correctional Center in Virginia.  They recorded their 1979 album <em>Eyes of Love</em> during a strict five-hour window inside the facility. The record became an improbable soul music sensation.</p>
