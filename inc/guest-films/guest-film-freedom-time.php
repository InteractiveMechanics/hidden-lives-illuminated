<h3>Freedom / Time</h3>
<p>Eleven incarcerated artists from Stateville Correctional Center were asked to draw 100 frames of animation using tracing paper and pencil based on their thoughts on freedom and time. These vignettes are the results of their explorations.  The presentation of this film by 96 Acres in Chicago helped <a href="https://www.easternstate.org/hiddenlives/about-the-project/" target="_blank">inspire <em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em></a>.</p>
