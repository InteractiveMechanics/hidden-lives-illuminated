				<p>There is a common observation among people who live and work in prisons: “The walls don’t just keep the prisoners in... They keep the public out.”</p>
				<p><em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em> will bring the often invisible stories of people living in prisons to light against the backdrop of Eastern State Penitentiary's dramatic stone walls. The series will feature nightly screenings of newly-commissioned, animated short films created by currently-incarcerated artists living in Pennsylvania correctional institutions.</p>
				<p>Using a concert-grade digital projector, films will be screened onto a 20-by-30-foot area of Eastern State’s façade each night from August 15 through September 12, 2019. A total of 21 original short films will be shown throughout the month, offering a rare look inside America’s correctional system, conceived, narrated and animated by incarcerated people. Screenings will be free and open to the public, and content will be appropriate for people of all ages.</p>
				<p>The nightly screenings will be grouped into four themed weeks, each addressing subjects such as “Community and Family Impact” or “Restorative Justice.”  During a given week, audiences will see about five original short films that touch on that week’s theme. Additional animated guest films, all created by filmmakers close to the criminal justice system, will round out the nightly screenings.</p>
				<p>During each screening, additional programs will feature presentations by scholars, community leaders, activists, artists, victims’ advocates, and elected officials. Hands-on activities will provide families a chance to reflect on the films and discuss social and criminal justice issues.</p>
				<p>The project will culminate in a one-night festival on September 12, during which all 21 original films will be screened back to back.  A documentary film about the artists will play inside the historic site’s cellblocks.</p>
				<p>Eastern State Penitentiary is committed to deepening the conversation about criminal justice reform in the United States. With <em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em>, we can structure these conversations around the literal voices of men and women living inside prisons today. Prisons are some of the most inaccessible spaces in America. We want to use our wall to illuminate the lives of people living inside these institutions that are so often misunderstood, or worse, ignored.</p>
				<p><em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em> has been in development for three years. Teaching artists employed by Eastern State Penitentiary have been leading classes in storytelling, screen writing, narration and animation inside Pennsylvania correctional institutions since the summer of 2018. <em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em> was inspired by "<a href="https://vimeo.com/100728960" target="_blank">Freedom/Time</a>," a project orchestrated by artist Damon Locks and developed with the Jane Addams Hull House and Prison + Neighborhood Arts Project, as presented by the 96 Acres Project in Chicago, September 15, 2015.</p>
