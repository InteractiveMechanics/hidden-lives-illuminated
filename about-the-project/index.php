				<p>There is a common observation among people who live and work in prisons: “The walls don’t just keep the prisoners in... They keep the public out.” Eastern State Penitentiary’s <em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em> will bring the often invisible stories of people living in prisons to light against the backdrop of the penitentiary's 30-foot-high stone walls. The project was inspired by the work of artist Damon Locks, as presented at 96 Acres in Chicago.</p>
				<p><em>Hidden Lives Illuminated</em> offers a rare look into daily life inside America’s correctional system through newly commissioned, animated short films created by currently-incarcerated artists. The films will be projected onto Eastern State’s façade each night for one month, spotlighting the prisoners' joy, rage, boredom, heartbreak, or dreams. </p> 
				<p>Screenings will be free and open to the public. Each screening will feature five films that address a common theme. This theme, and the films featured, will change weekly. A total of twenty films will be shown throughout the month. A screening schedule will be announced soon.</p>
				<p>Concurrent programs hosted by community ambassadors every evening will provide an opportunity to reflect on the films and discuss related social and criminal justice issues. The project will culminate in a one-night festival during which all twenty films will be screened on Eastern State's façade while a documentary about the artists plays inside the historic site’s cellblocks.</p>
